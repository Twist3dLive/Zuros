                Zuros has a 16 month calendar years, with each of the 16 months being named after the original 16 gods and
                goddesses that conqured Zuros from the primordials. Each month is 4 weeks long with each week consistind
                of 8 days. The days in Zuros are always a little bit longer than our own, lasting 32 hours with, 16 hours of
                daylight, and 16 hours of night. It is said that the days and nights used to incredibly different when
                dragons were the primary species across Zurs, however it is said that it changed when Inir (God, of the Sun)
                and Yros (Goddess, of the Moon) were approached by the new god Kiten (God, of Knowledge and Science) who proposed
                that this order of the day and night cycle would be both better for the gods and mortals on Zuros.
