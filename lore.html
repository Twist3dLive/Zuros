            <h1>The Ancient Times</h1>
            <p>
                Not much is known about the state of Zuros before the Gods arrived and to describe anything about this
                time period as known history is incorrect. The time before the Gods is best described as a confusing mix of
                history, myth, and legend. At best man has been told conflicting accounts from various Gods, with some of
                the original Gods saying they manifested into Zuros while others say that they traveled to Zuros from
                another far distant world.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, something all original Gods constantly describe is the fact that strange primordial beings existed
                on Zuros before them, and a great war was fought over control over the world with the Gods comming out
                victorious in the end. It is said that most of the primordial creatures were slain by the Gods, but a
                handful of them did escape and either fled to other worlds or went into hiding.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h1>The Great Dawn</h1>
            <p>
                Some time after the war between the Gods and the ancient primordial beings Zuros was left in ruins. After
                the dust settled new life began to emerge. Information given to us by the Gods has lead to many sages to the
                conclusion that life developed in several ways from this point on, with some life evolving naturally with
                the Gods only occasionally stepping in to nudge it in the direction they'd like, or just creating new life
                from nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is during this time that the Gods took notice of dinosaurs and their great power and potential. The Gods
                used their magic and influence to mold the dinosaurs into the first dragons.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h1>The Eon of Dragons</h1>
            <p>
                Dragons quickly spread across all of Zuros, splitting into sever different variants and subspecies over millions
                of years. During this time the Gods began to notice that the dragons became arrogant and the race that they
                envisioned as great potential servants, started seeing themselves as superior to the Gods.
            </p>
            <p>
                While no one is sure when exactly the Dragon War started, we do know that the fighting lasted longer than any
                mortal could comprehend, even lasting longer than the Gods original war with the primorials. It has been said
                by the Gods that they had to face off against millions if not billions of dragons who sought to replace the
                as the controllers of Zuros.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the end while the dragons put up a good fight even better than the primordials, they eventually were
                defeated by the Gods. After the failure of their rebellion most if not all dragons abandoned the idea
                of defeating the Gods, this combined with the fact that many dragons subspecies started developing different
                outlook, philosophies, and general outlooks on the world resulted in them also fighting amongst themselves.
                With some dragons even becoming clerics and paladins for some of the Gods and fighting on their behalf. To
                this day another dragon empire has never risen again and likely never will.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Gods after barely recovering from their war with the Primordials and then having to defeat the dragons were
                severely weakened. The Gods combined the last of their remaining strength to raise what is now Mt. Celeste
                and construed a home for themselves, a place they could recover and watch over the world in.
            </p>

            <h1>The Rise of Man</h1>
            <p>
                After millions and millions of years the world slowly began to settle again into a time of prosperity.
                Life once again had emerged from the destructions of one of the Gods wars and spread throughout Zuros, with the
                Gods yet again influencing its development. However, this time the Gods did so with a lot more caution, with
                humanity eventually emerging and resembling the Gods forms much closer than that of the dragons.
            </p>
            <p>
                While one again intrigued by the natural life that developed on Zuros, the Gods who wanted to push the
                species of man forward gave man what is best described as small "nudges" instead of completely reshaping
                them like they did the dragons. Several Gods took man in many different directions, that combined with
                natural evolution gave us the many humanoid races we know today like Humans, Elves, Dwarves, etc. Some
                Gods were even inspired to create some entirely new beings.
            </p>

            <h1>The First Era (????-0)</h1>
            <p>
                The First Era, can be characterized by the rise and expansion of numerous humanoid empires across all of Zuros.
