This website is being made to host the information for my TTRPG world Zuros, I currently use World Anvil but due to its cost and many features being locked behind a paywall may of which I won't even use. I decided that I will just make my own website and host it here so everyone can see it or use it as a template to make their own with. 

The world of Zuros itself is a traditional high fantasy setting meant to be the main setting of all my future ttrpg campaigns, with each one affecting the world and its development. Currently I am using the D&D 5e system but will likely move to another in the future.
